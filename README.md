# Word-Guess-Game

This is a Star Wars themed game of hangman. User should be able to start the game by pressing enter. A random word will be generated and user can guess letters until the word has been guessed or user is out of guesses. I was not able to fix the logic for the game, yet. The game starts correctly. When the user selects a letter the code breaks and the game becomes inopperable.
